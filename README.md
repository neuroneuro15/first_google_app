# first_google_app
The first app I've worked on while learning the Google App Engine with Python by following *Build Awesome Stuff*'s [Learn to build scalable web applications](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLdqn_b7Fi_PSKAeO5F8wmA3YmXOtL5wAA) Youtube tutorials.  This code is from Sections 1 and 2, which provides a simple introduction to:
  - Web Requests
  - HTML
  - Python
  - Google App Engine (including installation)
  - Jinja2 Template Engine
  - Source File Directory Organization

I greatly reccomend it, and hope you enjoy it as much as I did! :-)
